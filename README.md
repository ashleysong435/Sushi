## Why You Should Choose Sushi as your Next Special Meal!!!!!

### Taste
If you are skeptical about the taste of raw fish, you should think twice. As anyone would know, sushi has many different flavors. Depending on the certain type of sauce that is paired with sushi, this could bring about new flavors. Personally, in my experience, I love to dip my sushi in soy sauce mixed with a hint of wasabi to give it a sweet but a bit spicy taste. Eating sushi without the sauce is also a great choice, since there are many different kinds of sushi, each with their own unique taste. From rolls to sashimi, sushi could be sweet or savory. It could also be in-between. If you are one of the people who prefer spicy food, there is even a choice of a spicy option for sushi. So even if you don't like the taste of raw fish, with so many choices for sushi to choose from, you might discover a certain taste that you may actually like and eventually love.

### Texture
While many people focus on the taste of the food they chose, texture could be another factor for that person to pick that certain dish. Sushi is generally soft and chewy, making it melt in your mouth, leaving you with a sense of content and satisfaction. This is a great choice for those who love soft textures of food in general. But, if you're one of the people who love crunchy and crispy foods, then you could chose sushi that is covered with a special batter coating, leaving the end result with a crispy treat when fried. Tiger rolls and dragon rolls are examples of crispy fried sushi.
